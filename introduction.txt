Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello, my name is Ife-olowa Oyeniran. I am 18 years old. I live in Lagos with my mom and siblings, an older brother and a junior sister. I come from Oyo state, Afijio local government area to be precise. I love eating yam and egg.
My favourite colours are blue and black and I like handcrafts.
